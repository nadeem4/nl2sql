Physical schema coverage exists via a concrete table match 'machines' in multiple datasources (manufacturing_ops, manufacturing_sqlite, manufacturing_ref). Because the entity_id must be assigned to exactly one datasource and the canonical query selects directly from 'machines' (a base table) without needing auxiliary tables, choose a datasource where 'machines' is a primary operational table match rather than relying on examples. 'manufacturing_ops' provides a direct table match to 'machines' and represents the most specific operational source among the candidates; no decomposition is required because only entity_id 'machine' is present and it is assigned to a single datasource."
